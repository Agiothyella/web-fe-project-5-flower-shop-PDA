### Design:

To give user calm feeling when browsing the page, pastel color is used. The color composition is made like that to immitate flower, bright color at the top to darker one at the bottom. The biggest concern is this many other colors on images that fills the sections (like special sale one) messing up the overall color palette, especially for palette on specific section. But removing that will cause the section to feels empty. So I decided to just live with it.

### Development:

DRY principle applied for script, Overall code is cleaner than before.

Proper HTML 5 tags is applied so SEO wise it's better, also there's no structural problem found thanks to that.
